# Simple Bank System

Concepts Used: Arrays, conditions, loops, switch, user input
Description:
Create a console app that allows users to:
- Log in using a username and password.
- Check their balance.
- Deposit money.
- Withdraw money.
- Transfer money to another user.
Guidelines:
- Use 3 arrays: usernames[], passwords[], and balances[].
- Ask the user for their username and password to log in.
- If login succeeds, show a simple menu:
1 → Check Balance
2 → Deposit
3 → Withdraw
4 → Transfer
5 → Exit
- Loop the menu until the user chooses to exit.
- Validate all actions (e.g., don’t allow withdrawing more than balance).
